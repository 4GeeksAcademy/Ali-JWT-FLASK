title: 'Start a React + Flask (Full-Stack) Project'
description: 'Use Javascript, React.js, Python and Flask to build an entire full-stack application'
---

This template has `backend files` and `front end files` together, its the perfect combination from the React Flux and the Flask API templates so that you can create a Full Stack application applying all the concepts used in the professional world.

## Front end

You can find a thorough explanation on how to create new pages, components, adding styles and using the context, inside [this previous documentation we create for the React Flux template](/starters/flux). This is because the Full-Stack Template was created under the same structure and concepts as that one.

## Backend

You can find a thorough explanation on creating your Flask API endpoints, creating new models, database migrations and using the flask admin [on this documentation](/starters/flask), this is because this template was created with the same structure and concepts as the Flask API Template.


## Manual Installation (only if needed)

### Back-End Manual Installation:

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8+, Pipenv and a database engine (Posgress recomended)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pipenv install`
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example: `$ cp .env.example .env`
3. Install your database engine and create your database, depending on your database you have to create a DATABASE_URL variable with one of the possible values, make sure yo replace the valudes with your database information:
